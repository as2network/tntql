A bill of lading is the document of title to the goods issued to the customer which confirms the carrier&#39;s receipt of the cargo from the customer, acknowledging goods being shipped and specifying the terms of delivery. The Sea Waybill is a simpler document, the main difference being that it is non-negotiable.

  # @param Float! scheduleID ID uniquely identifying a schedule, to filter events by.
  # @param Float! transportCallID ID uniquely identifying a transport call, to filter events by.
