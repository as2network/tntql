  # The Transport Document ID number is an identifier that links to a shipment, i.e. a Bill of Lading or a Sea Waybill. A bill of lading is the document of title to the goods issued to the customer which confirms the carrier&#39;s receipt of the cargo from the customer, acknowledging goods being shipped and specifying the terms of delivery. The Sea Waybill is a simpler document, the main difference being that it is non-negotiable.
